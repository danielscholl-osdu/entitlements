# entitlements-v2-jdbc

entitlements-v2-jdbc is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) service which hosts CRUD APIs that enable management of user entitlements.
Data kept in GCP instance of Postgres database.


### Database structure

The database used in this implementation is PostgreSQL 13.0. The database structure and additional
info can be found [here][JDBC documentation].


### Requirements

In order to run this service from a local machine to Cloud Run, you need the following:

- [Maven 3.6.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [AdoptOpenJDK8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### General Tips

**Environment Variable Management**
The following tools make environment variable configuration simpler
 - [direnv](https://direnv.net/) - for a shell/terminal environment
 - [EnvFile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) - for [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

**Lombok**
This project uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for code generation. You may need to configure your IDE to take advantage of this tool.
 - [Intellij configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij)
 - [VSCode configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/vscode)

### Build and run the application

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*

```bash
# build + test + install core service code
$ ./mvnw clean install

# run service
#
# Note: this assumes that the environment variables for running the service as outlined
#       above are already exported in your environment.
$ java -jar $(find provider/entitlements-v2-jdbc/target/ -name '*-spring-boot.jar')

# Alternately you can run using the Maven Task
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl provider/entitlements-v2-jdbc
```


### Test the application


### Integration Tests

In order to run integration tests, you need to have the following environment variables defined:

**Required to run integration tests**

| Name | Value | Description | Sensitive? | Source |
| ---  | ---   | ---         | ---        | ---    |
| `ENTITLEMENT_V2_URL` | ex `http://localhost:8080/api/entitlements/v2/` | The host where the service is running | no | -- |
| `DOMAIN` | ex `contoso.com` | Must match the value of `service_domain_name` above | no | -- |
| `TENANT_NAME` | ex `opendes` | OSDU tenant used for testing | no | -- |
| `INTEGRATION_TESTER` | `********` | System identity to assume for API calls. Note: This user must have entitlements already configured | yes | -- |
| `INTEGRATION_TEST_AUDIENCE` | `********` | Client Id for `$INTEGRATION_TESTER` | yes | -- |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | `********` | System identity to provide access for cleaning up groups created during test | yes | -- |
| `AUTH_MODE` | `IAP` | Should be configured only if IAP enabled | no | -- |
| `IAP_URL` | `https://dev.osdu.club` | Should be configured only if IAP enabled | no | -- |

**Entitlements configuration for integration accounts**

| INTEGRATION_TESTER  | 
| --- |
| users<br/>service.entitlements.user<br/>service.entitlements.admin |


#### Using Cloud Infrastructure

1. Run Entitlements V2 service from JDBC provider (assumed that all the required environment variables specified for using Cloud Infrastructure).

2. Define environment variables for integration tests (e.g. maven options).
   
3. Run integration tests:

```bash
# build + install integration test core
$ ./mvnw compile -f testing/entitlements-v2-test-core

# build + run JDBC integration tests.
$ ./mvnw test -f testing/entitlements-v2-test-jdbc
```
